<header><h1> About me </h1></header>

I am a recent graduate with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in 
robotics at Boulder's ever-beautiful the University of Colorado. Originally from Mumbai, 
I am an ambitious person who loves to create robots. Isaac Asimov kindled my passion and 
since then, I have been pursuing my dream to become a roboticist. I'm a huge fan of anime 
and The Office show. I usually go for a run or play table tennis. Also, poems and cooking 
are a frequent indulgence.
