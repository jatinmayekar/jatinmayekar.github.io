I am a recent graduate with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in
robotics at Boulder's ever-beautiful the University of Colorado. Originally from Mumbai,
I am an ambitious person who loves to create robots. Isaac Asimov kindled my passion and

and The Office show. I usually go for a run or play table tennis. Also, poems and cooking
are a frequent indulgence.
