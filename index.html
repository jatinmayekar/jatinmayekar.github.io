<header><h2> Biography </h2></header>
<p align="justify">
  I am a recent graduate with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering specializing in robotics
   at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Originally from Mumbai, my ambitions have me
   placed halfway across the world learning how to build robots. Isaac Asimov, a Hugo award
   winner for the best novel, the Foundation Series, kindled my passion for becoming a roboticist.
   On a side note, I'm a huge fan of Anime and The Office show. During my breaks, I usually
   go for a run or play table tennis. Also, reading and cooking are frequent indulgences.
